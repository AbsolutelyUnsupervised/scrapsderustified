# SCRAPS DERUSTIFIED

So, long story short I noticed that the "Scraps" author has been inactive for over a year on both the moddb and the vintage story server. And I love the idea of recycling and reusing stuff. And I don't want the idea of reusing the clutter to get lost.

SO! this is my take on reusing and recycling clutter specifically.

## Implemented so far:
- github repository, for ease of access to the source code of the mod,
- github issues & milestones, for ease of reporting problems with the mod,
- github discussions, for ease of conversations regarding the mod, as well as community building.

## Planned features:
- ability to RECYCLE ALL clutter items,
- ability to CRAFT majority if not ALL clutter items,
- ability to RESTORE majority of clutter items, making them pretty and usable,
- proper handbook information for ALL recycling, crafting, and fixing recipes involving clutter,
- ORDER in the creative tabs for clutter, to allow for ease of creation involving clutter,
- COMPATIBILITY with as many active mods as possible,
- GAME BALANCE, so that the recycling and fixing recipes are not either game breaking, or too tedious,
- github wiki, for ease of finding information about the mod online.


### Optional ideas - these are features that I thought might be neat to add in one of future updates, but have lesser priority, might be split to separate mods, and will most likely require community's desire and cooperation to actually have these features:
- old versions compatibility, for players that prefer to play on older versions,
- new variants for the clutter items, to allow for further personalization of various clutter items,
- recycling, crafting, and restoring recipes for clutter items from other mods,
- translations to as many languages as possible - I (VesPuppy) only know English and Polish, so there arent many languages I'd be able to translate the mod to. In order to fulfill this goal I'd need a lot of help from the community, translating the mod to other languages.
