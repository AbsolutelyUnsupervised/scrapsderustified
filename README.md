# SCRAPS DERUSTIFIED


So, long story short I noticed that the "Scraps" author has been inactive for over a year on both the moddb and the vintage story server. And I love the idea of recycling and reusing stuff. And I don't want the idea of reusing the clutter to get lost.

SO! this is my take on reusing and recycling clutter specifically.


## Implemented so far:
- github repository, for ease of access to the source code of the mod,
- github issues, for ease of reporting problems with the mod.

## Planned features:
- ability to break down ALL clutter items,
- ability to craft majority if not ALL clutter items,
- proper handbook information for ALL recycling and fixing recipes involving clutter,
- ORDER in the creative tabs for clutter, to allow for ease of creation involving clutter,
- COMPATIBILITY with as many active mods as possible,
- GAME BALANCE, so that the recycling and fixing recipes are not either game breaking, or too tedious.
